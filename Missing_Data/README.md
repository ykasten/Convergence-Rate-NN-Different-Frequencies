The code here generates the right plot in figure 1.

The training is performed in python using PyTorch.

# Files

`mainAndPlot.py`

Runs the simulation, plots, saves results. Same as running `main.ipynb` and `plot.ipynb`, but without the live plot.

`main.ipynb`

Contains configuration. Runs the simulation and saves the results as `.pkl`. Keeps a live progression plot (updated once every 100 epochs)

`gen_data.py`

Generates training data for `main`.

`plot.ipynb`

Plots in the Jupyter notebook. Saves figure as `.jpg`. Saves results as `.mat` (to allow plotting with Matlab)

`../mat_plotting/readAndPlot.m`

Reads results in '.mat' format and generates plots as in the paper
(requires results from other simulations as well).

# Folders

`results`

Will contain output as `.pkl` file.

`figures`

Will contain figures as `.jpg` file.

`../mat_plotting/results`

Will contain results as `.mat` file.

`../mat_plotting/figures`

Will contain figures generated by Matlab.
