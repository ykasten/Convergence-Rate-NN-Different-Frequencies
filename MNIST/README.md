The code here generates the left plot in figure 1.

The training is performed in python using TensorFlow.

# Files

`mainAndPlot.py`

Runs the simulation and saves results as `.npz` file, plots and saves the figure as `.jpg` file, saves the results to a `.mat` file.

`config.py`

Contains configuration.

`optimize.py`

Called by main.

`../mat_plotting/readAndPlot.m`

Reads results in '.mat' format and generates plots as in the paper
(requires results from other simulations as well).

# Folders

`results`

Will contain output as `.npz` file.

`figures`

Will contain figures as `.jpg` file.

`../mat_plotting/results`

Will contain results as `.mat` file.

`../mat_plotting/figures`

Will contain figures generated by Matlab.
