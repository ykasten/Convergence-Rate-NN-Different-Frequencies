The code here generates figure 2.

# Files

`main.ipynb`

Contains configuration. Runs the simulation and saves the results as `.pkl`. Keeps a live progression plot (updated once every 100 epochs)

`plot.ipynb`

Plots in the Jupyter notebook. Saves figure as `.jpg`. Saves results as `.mat` (to allow plotting with Matlab)

`gen_data_package.py`

Generates training data for `main`.

`../mat_plotting/readAndPlot.m`

Reads results in '.mat' format and generates plots as in the paper
(requires results from other simulations as well).

# Folders

`figures`

Will contain figures as `.jpg` file.

`../mat_plotting/results`

Will contain results as `.mat` file.

`../mat_plotting/figures`

Will contain figures generated by Matlab.
