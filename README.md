## Use
The shallow neural network experiments run in Matlab. 
The deep neural network experiments run in Python (with PyTorch). 
Code for all other plots is in Python as well, some of it is in .ipynb format (Jupyter Notebook) and allows for live plotting.
The plots generation code is written in Matlab.
